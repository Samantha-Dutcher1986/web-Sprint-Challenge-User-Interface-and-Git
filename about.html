  1. If you were to describe semantic HTML to the next cohort of students, what would you say?
  Semantic HTML is one of the most important aspects you will need to know in order to give your code meaning.

2. Name two big differences between ```display: block;``` and ```display: inline;```.
  display: inline-block allows you to set a width and height and the top and bottom margins/paddings are respected, but with display: inline they are not.

3. What are the 4 areas of the box model?
  The content, padding, border, and margin

4. While using flexbox, what axis does the following property work on: ```align-items: center```?
Cross-axis (horizontal)

5. Explain why git is valuable to a team of developers.
  It allows everyone to make their own changes to the documents or project without overwriting anyone else's work because each member can fork and clone their own copy of the original.
You are expected to be able to answer all these questions. Your responses contribute to your Sprint Challenge grade. Skipping this section *will* prevent you from passing this challenge.
